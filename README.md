# React Starter
#### Boilerplate for React â€“ includes hot reloading for jsx and postcss.

Initially based off of [Essential React](https://github.com/pheuter/essential-react), this has been tweaked to fit my needs and fixed to include hot reloading on style changes.

Includes various PostCSS plugins such as a simple grid and cssnext.
